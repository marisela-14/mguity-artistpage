            <p>Marisela's music journey began when she was in elementary school. By the time she was in first grade, she had already had experience with playing the piano, violin and of course singing. She grew up singing in many different choirs ranging from church choirs to citywide choirs such as Bosnton Children's Chorus.<br><br> 
                When Marisela arrived at college, she joined an acapella ensemble her freshman year. During her sophmore, she joined a Hip Hop and R&B ensemble to overcome her stage fright. This is when she found her alter ego <em>Mari</em> and started rapping. Her first demo was hot and got her a lot of recognition in her ensemble. Her first feature was fire as well and since then, it has been all hits no misses.<br><br>
                Mari has performed at many venues in New Orleans from Tipitinas to Gasa Gasa. However, her Loyola debut performance was January 30th of 2023, where she performed with Glbl Wrmng's very own Alfred Banks.<br><br>
                Although she sometimes struggles with taking in the fact that she is a very talented artist, her mentors and peers encourage her and believe she has what it takes to compete in the industry. Be on the lookout for her as she is excited to leave her mark on the industry!
